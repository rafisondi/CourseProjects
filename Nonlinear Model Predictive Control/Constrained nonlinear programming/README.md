# Nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)
This course included implementing linear and finally nonlinear MPC, while using sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and multiple shooting. 
Most of these files were done using Simulink on Matlab and Github refuses to upload these files. 

Exercise 8 includes a matlab file implementation of constrained nonlinear programming using qpOASES as a solver for quadratic problems.
