Introduction to machine learning tasks which included:

  - Ridge Regression of a simple dataset (Task1)
  - Training of a deep NN (Task2):
      Given a dataset of medical tests performed on patients and the corresponding medical tests that were subsequently ordered, we trained our NN to decide which medical tests are needed given some patient data.
 
  - Training of a NN based on image classification (Task3): Given three images of food, a person grouped two images similar in "taste". Our NN needed to reach the same conclusions.
  
Unfortunately I can't find my original files of this course (Task description and my solution of task 3).
